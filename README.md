# TextEditor

## Introduction
The project is part of MOOC course 'Data Structures and Performance' under Specialization 'Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond' offered by University of California, San Diego. 
Aim of this project is to build a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including **autocomplete, flagging misspelled words** and **spelling auto-correct**. 

The code being developed here is what’s called “back-end” code, in that I worked with the text, and not directly with any user interface components. This facilitates to focus and really dig in and experiment with the different data structures learnt and analyze running times for each of them.
